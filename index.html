When a language dies out, the cultural values and traditions of the former speakers are at risk of being erased from history. How common are endangered languages across the globe?</p>

                <section class="map2container">
                    <p class="map2text">Intuitively, the less speakers of a language, the more endangered it is. Therefore, less endangered languages were overrepresented by their size in the previous visualisation. This visualisation remedies that by excluding the speaker count for each language, allowing us to see the spread of endangered languages more clearly.</p>

                    <p class="map1text">This bar chart shows the severity of endangerment that languages face across the world. Unfortunately, there are still a very large amount of languages that are critically endangered, meaning these languages face the threat of imminent exctinction.</p>

                <section class="map2container">
                    <p class="map2text">From the map we can observe that the United States has the largest amount of endangerment with 227 recorded languages, followed by India with 199 and Brazil with 190. These countries all share large land-mass and enormous linguistic diversity, making them more susceptible to language endangerment.</p>

                <p class="footer-para">Unfortunately, a large amount of languages today face the imminent threat of exctinction, and its only likely to get worse. It is difficult to put a finger on exactly one reason for why languages die - instead, it can be a result of many different factors such as linguistic evolution or colonisation. When these languages die, the cultures of their former speakers also risk dying out too. Therefore, it is important that we try to capture what remains of these languages before they become the remnants of a culture lost to time.</p>
